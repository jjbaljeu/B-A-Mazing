This maze solving app is inspired by this YouTube video: https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=Youtube+maze+solving&docid=608045714251066146&mid=D2A4583EA8D0F942917CD2A4583EA8D0F942917C&view=detail&FORM=VIRE
There you can also find some sample mazes.
The app is just implementing some ideas without looking at the Python code provied with the video or researching maze solving algorithms.
Just palyed around a little with it to se how it performs in Visual Basic and C#.
